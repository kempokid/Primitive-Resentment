  myConversation:
  - (I walk into the lab room and am taken aback by the sight before me)
  - Told you it would be an impressive glimpse into what we've been able to do.
  - We've been able to get so far in altering life itself.
  - This isn't just for mere spectacle, from here we'll be able to fo even further,
    this could lead to some serious breakthroughs.
  - This is the future!

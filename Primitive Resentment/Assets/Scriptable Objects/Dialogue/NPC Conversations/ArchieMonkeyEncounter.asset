  myConversation:
  - (I unfold the cape John gave me and present it to Archie)
  - 'Is that? '
  - 'Is that his cape? '
  - Is this nightmare finally over? Finally time to start rebuilding?
  - It's a shame how things turned out, years of research wasted, but this time around,
    I won't make the same mistakes as before.
  - No matter how far I may fall, I can kickstart this empire of mine once again,
    after all, this zoo will surely rehire despite these setbacks.
  - Nobody else is making them the next big thing, I'm in the clear, we can sweep
    all this under the rug and continue going.
  - Wait... why the hell is it still here?!

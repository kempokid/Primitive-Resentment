  myConversation:
  - You've done well to make this happen.
  - You have my eternal gratitude for bringing this vile worm out from his hiding
    place.
  - Now it's time to END THIS.
  - AAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
  - EEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  - (While John lunges at Archie, I notice that Archie seems to be pulling something
    out of his pocket)
  - AAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
  - (John no longer seems to be screaming in anger, he seems in pain, what the hell
    did Archie do?)

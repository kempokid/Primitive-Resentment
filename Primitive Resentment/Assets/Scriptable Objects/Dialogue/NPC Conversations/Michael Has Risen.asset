  myConversation:
  - What's that look on your face for?
  - Expecting someone different to show up?
  - I've got something important to tell yo- oh are those breadsticks? Gimme some.
  - '*crunch*'
  - Anyway, as I was saying, there's something important to tell you.
  - There's another facility, the incident from 3 years ago was not the end of all
    this.
  - I know I've made my mistakes, but the 3 years since then have given me plenty
    of time to think things over.
  - What do you say partner? Shall we end this once and for all?

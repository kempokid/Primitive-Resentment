  myConversation:
  - (You see that the monkey is now carrying a Speak and Spell to talk with.)
  - Your friend, he had it coming
  - I don't expect you to understand, your friend was sick, and it was my job to
    cure him
  - If you value your life, you will turn away and leave. Else you may share the
    same fate
  - If you can escape this room, that is.

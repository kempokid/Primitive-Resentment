  myConversation:
  - Anyway man, long time no see? This situation is pretty crazy. About the monkey,
    not the situation with my wonderful girlfriend.
  - Most of the building's already locked down, but I need to make sure the generators
    are running properly and the vents are sealed so nothing bad happens.
  - I'm kinda nervous being here, been thinking about proposing to my girl when we
    finish this job, I even bought this ring for her.
  - She's the love of my life, man. I won't let anything come between us, especially
    not some zoo animal.
  - Thinkin' about taking her out to the country, in my old hometown, settling down,
    living the quiet life, y'know?
  - Just us, as a family. That's all I want, y'know?
  - 'Anyway, I''m going to the left to check the generator room, don''t follow me
    in. Check the Maintenance Room on the right and see if we could use anything.  '
  - I'll go ahead and think about my future wife for a bit. I repeat, do not follow
    after me, it might be dangerous after all.

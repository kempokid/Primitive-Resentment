  myConversation:
  - (I look over next to the chairs and see Archie, the head scientist covering under
    a table)
  - Oh thank god someone's finally here, thought for sure that my hiding place would
    have stopped working.
  - Considering you've made it this far, I'll assume that you still haven't killed
    that beast yet.
  - 'I''d have activated the fail safe on my own, but I''ve unfortunately misplaced
    it somewhere and cannot move from under this table for fear of getting discovered. '
  - I thought there might have been a way to capture him without having to resort
    to killing him, but at this point I fear that it's the only viable path forward.
  - I don't care about preserving my work on him anymore, just destroy that filthy
    animal and get this over with.
  - Ignore me for the time being, don't draw anymore attention or he might find me,
    get out there and take him out.

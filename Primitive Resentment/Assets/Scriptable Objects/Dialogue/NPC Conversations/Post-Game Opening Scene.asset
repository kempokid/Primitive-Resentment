  myConversation:
  - So, this is the place where I was told to meet up with them.
  - A bit odd that it was just a letter slipped under my door that told me to come
    here, but even so I just had a feeling that I'd want to meet this person.
  - Maybe I'm insane and this was all a dumb prank anyway.
  - 'Might as well help myself to some of these breadsticks while I''m here at least. '

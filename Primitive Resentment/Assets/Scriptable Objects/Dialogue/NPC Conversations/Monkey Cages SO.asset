  myConversation:
  - Do you think me a savage? A monster? A killer?
  - You are sadly mistaken, but I cannot blame you. You couldn't possibly know the
    truth
  - Though I'm sure you know part of the truth. I was a horrible person in life,
    I can see that now
  - But trapped as a freak, like this, I have a second chance, a chance to attone
    for my wrongs.
  - What you see before you is not brutality, it is mercy. A life lost is better
    than a life lived like this
  - I will give you one more chance.
  - Turn away, before you learn a truth you cannot forget

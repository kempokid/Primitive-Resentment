  myConversation:
  - Do you think me a savage? A monster? A killer?
  - You are sadly mistaken, though that could not be your fault. You've been fed
    lies by those that would use you for their own twisted goals.
  - Though... You must know some of it. I can see now, I was wrong, I was a monster.
    But none of that matters anymore
  - But trapped like this... I cannot atone for my misdeeds, but I can do justice,
    just this once, for the sake of those I've hurt
  - What you see before you is not brutality, it is mercy. A life lost is better
    than a life lived like this
  - I will give you one more chance.
  - Turn away, before you learn a truth you cannot handle

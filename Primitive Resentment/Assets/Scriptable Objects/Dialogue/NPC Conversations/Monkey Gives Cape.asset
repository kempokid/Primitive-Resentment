  myConversation:
  - You must be wondering about this room, and me.
  - 'I cannot give you all the answers, but I''m sure that even you can understand
    the situation enough. '
  - 'They kept part of the original brain during the procedure, I still feel all
    the pain, the fear, the suffering that that monkey felt. '
  - I may have done bad things, many, many bad things, but that's NOTHING compared
    to what I've ended up feeling.
  - I am no monkey anymore, I am human, a human trapped in the body of a monkey.
  - 'And for what? To become a mere attraction at a zoo? Put on display for all to
    see? '
  - What sort of life is that!!!!!
  - If you truly consider me to be worth helping, take my cape, not only a sign of
    trust, but I feel you know what to do with it.

  myConversation:
  - Ah, I see you've finally arrived
  - You can finally see me in my humble cell, but what do you plan on doing?
  - Will you kill me?
  - Still trying to enact vengeance for your pathetic friend Michael?
  - Or have you realised the true nature of this ordeal?
  - No matter the case however, I'll ask you to call me John from now on, my real
    name.
  - Finally caught on to who the true animals are all along I assume?
  - Good, then we can talk further.

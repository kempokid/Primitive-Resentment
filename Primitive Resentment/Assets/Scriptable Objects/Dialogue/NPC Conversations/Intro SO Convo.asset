  myConversation:
  - Remember, you're down here to stop him. That... thing, is a merciless killer,
    he was as a human, and still is now
  - You should be able to stop him with the fail safe I gave you, if you can get
    close enough to him
  - I've arranged for someone to meet up with you inside, you remember your old friend,
    Michael Huntley? He'll meet you inside. Just head in from there, he'll have the
    keycard.
  - Remember, you're dealing with an infamous serial killer. Don't let your guard
    down.

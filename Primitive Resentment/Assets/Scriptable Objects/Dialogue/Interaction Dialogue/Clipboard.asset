  myConversation:
  - Seems like a list of something that went down here.
  - 'Subject 1 - Results were promising, but lack of any visible differences made
    it a poor candidate for out goals. Note: Died a week later.'
  - Subject 2 - Some progress was made, definite potential with this one, but poor
    initial choice in which parts to use made it flop around uselessly before shortly
    dying.
  - Subject 3 - Some serious progress here, functioned well for a while before convulsing
    violently. Feels like we we're missing a single component to bring this together.
  - Subject 4 - A sad product of overambition, trying to include multiple functioning
    heads was bound to end in disaster. Complete wash.
  - Subject 5 - Decided to try the same combination as with subject 3 again. Turns
    out that it was just the combination that was off, ended up dying the same way
    as before, we won't be trying this again.
  - Subject 6, Joanne - Special circumstances gave us another subject to use for
    this. The process went well, the conflicting parts didn't reject each other.
  - 'Note: Unfortunate side effects of subject 6 seemed to have triggered insanity.
    Joanne was found dead shortly after. Fortunately we know that the next subject
    has a far stronger will.'

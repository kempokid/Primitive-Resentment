  myConversation:
  - I feel that this may be the last one.
  - '"I cannot believe I''ve been working towards this, this is utterly revolting." '
  - '"All this time, we were working towards THIS?!"'
  - '"This goes far beyond immoral, this is downright evil, twisted, utterly deranged."'
  - '"Doing all that''s been done to these animals for the sake of catching attention,
    going as far as performing these experiments on a human, I just can''t believe
    it."'
  - '"At this point I can''t trust Archie or the other person enough to give me a
    straight answer, they''re up to something and I will find out what."'
  - '"I think I''ve also been found out by Archie, I''ve been asked to come in and
    see him at the end of today"'
  - '"I think I''ve also been found out by Archie, I''ve been asked to come in and
    see him at the end of today"'
  - '"I have a feeling that this might be the end for me, so instead of running,
    I''ll trying and expose them, I''ll leave my journal entries all around the facility"'
  - '"Hopefully someone''s able to find enough of these to piece together what''s
    happened and bring these people down."'
  - '" - Joanne"'

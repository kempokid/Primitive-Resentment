  myConversation:
  - It's another one of these entries.
  - '"We got our first batch of test subjects in, a wide variety of animals, ranging
    from cats, to rats, to even some horses and monkeys"'
  - '"Despite that, I think there''s something a bit strange going on"'
  - '"Recently found out that the zoo''s financial situation has been plummeting
    as of late, and yet, they seem to be doubling down on how much they pay us."'
  - '"There''s also this other new guy who''s been working closely with Archie as
    of late, I don''t know much about him at all yet."'
  - '"He seems very commited to this work, almost as if he''s trying to push things
    along so he can go back and get to something on the outside of this."'
  - '"That said, maybe it''s a good thing for there to be someone pushing this all
    forward, can''t complain about productivity."'

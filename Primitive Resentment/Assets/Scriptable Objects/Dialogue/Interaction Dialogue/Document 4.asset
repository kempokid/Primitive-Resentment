  myConversation:
  - Yet another one of these.
  - '"If I wasn''t sure something odd was going on before, this basically confirms
    it to me"'
  - '"The animals have been getting taken away and never seen again at an alarming
    rate, we''ve already burned through the first group we got."'
  - '"The tests seem to have been going pretty poorly as well, Archie and the other
    higher up seem to be on edge almost constantly."'
  - '"That said, I''ve gotten to have a conversation with that other guy, and he
    seems nice enough."'
  - '"Talks a bit excessively about his girlfriend, but ah well, shows how devoted
    he is to her I guess."'
  - '"In any case, constantly hearing frustrations about how close they seem to be
    to the breakthrough is getting a bit disheartening."'
  - '"I hope they''re able to figure this out, I heard something about the lab getting
    a very special new test subject in the next week or so, maybe this could be what
    was needed"'

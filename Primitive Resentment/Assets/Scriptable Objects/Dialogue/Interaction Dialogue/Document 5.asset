  myConversation:
  - Maybe this will give some more information.
  - '"I''ve had it with the secrets at this point, I overheard a conversation between
    Archie and the zoo director about what this research is leading to, and I was
    confused."'
  - '"What''s this about this lab "making a new line of attractions to rake in the
    money?" What do we have to do with any of this?"'
  - '"Furthermore, that special test subject we got ended up being a person called
    John Collins, just what is going on?"'
  - '"At the very least I''ve heard that they set up a special room just for him
    past the restricted experimentation room, but it still feels wrong."'
  - '"At this point I can''t trust Archie or the other person enough to give me a
    straight answer, they''re up to something and I will find out what."'
  - '"I think I''ve figured out a way to get my hands on one of those keycards, and
    after I do, I''m going to be investigating this a bit further."'

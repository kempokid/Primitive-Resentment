  - Are you stupid?
  - Not even close
  - Really?
  - Oof
  - This room is idiot proof, and it shows
  - Actually I think you had it last time
  - Nice try, is what I would say if you didn't suck
  - Correct! Wait, nope, you still suck!
  - Anything that runs through your head comes out the other side
  - It's honestly not that hard
  - Having a rough day?
  - It's a miracle you can feed yourself
  - We can scratch "detective" from potential careers
  - $50 says you have no clue what you're doing
  - We can scratch "detective" from potential careers

  - Are you just... pressing randomly?
  - What's so hard to understand?
  - Beaten by a kids puzzle, sad...
  - Need a hint?
  - I'd say you can do it, but I'm not so sure
  - This is... really your best?

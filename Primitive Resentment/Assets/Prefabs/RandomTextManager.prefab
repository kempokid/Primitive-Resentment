  - Are you stupid?
  - Not even close
  - Really?
  - Oof
  - This room is idiot proof
  - Actually I think you had it last time
  - Nice try, is what I would say if you didn't suck
  - Correct! Wait, nope, you still suck!
  - Have you considered trying?
  - It's honestly not that hard
  - Having a rough day?
  - It's a miracle you can feed yourself
  - We can scratch "detective" from potential careers
  - $50 says you have no clue what you're doing
  - Woooooooooooooow
  - My 5 year old son figured out before you did
  - I'm glad you're here, I've needed a good laugh all day
  - You buffoon
  - This labratory is filled with genius, except the spot where you're standing
  - Are you just... pressing randomly?

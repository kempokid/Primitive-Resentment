  myConversation:
  - Hey man, long time no see? I assume you've already been run down on the situation?
    About the monkey, not the situation with my wonderful girlfriend
  - I've locked down most of the building, but I need to make sure the generators
    are running fine and the vents are sealed so nothing happens when we head in
  - I'm kinda nervous being here, been thinking about proposing to my girl when I
    leave here, I even bought this ring for her
  - She's the love of my life, man. I wont let anything come between us, especially
    not some zoo animal
  - Thinkin' about taking her out to the country, in my old hometown, settling down,
    living the quiet life, y'know?
  - Just us, as a family. That's all I want, y'know?
  - Anyway, wanna go into the Maintenance Room and grab the Generator Room key card
    so we can get this over with. I'll just stay here and think about my wife to
    be a little bit
